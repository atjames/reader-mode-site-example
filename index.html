    <h1>Lord of the Rings FAQ</h1>
    <p>A collection of frequently asked questions and answers about the story and lore of J.R.R. Tolkien's <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>What is the One Ring?</h2>
      <p>The One Ring was forged by the Dark Lord Sauron in the fires of Mount Doom during the Second Age. It was created to dominate the other Rings of Power and grant Sauron mastery over Middle-earth. The Ring corrupts its bearer and seeks to return to its master.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Why must the Ring be destroyed in Mount Doom?</h2>
      <p>The One Ring can only be destroyed in the fire where it was forged: the Cracks of Doom inside Mount Doom. No other weapon or force in Middle-earth has the power to unmake it.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Who are the members of the Fellowship of the Ring?</h2>
      <p>The Fellowship was formed at Rivendell to aid Frodo Baggins in his quest to destroy the Ring. Its nine members were: Frodo, Samwise Gamgee, Meriadoc Brandybuck, Peregrin Took, Gandalf the Grey, Aragorn son of Arathorn, Legolas of Mirkwood, Gimli son of Glóin, and Boromir of Gondor.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Why does Gollum call the Ring “my precious”?</h2>
      <p>Gollum once possessed the Ring for centuries, after discovering it by chance. Its corrupting influence twisted his mind and body, and he grew utterly obsessed with it. Calling it “my precious” shows the Ring’s hold over him.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What is Aragorn’s true identity?</h2>
      <p>Aragorn is the heir of Isildur, the ancient king who cut the Ring from Sauron’s hand. He is the rightful King of Gondor and Arnor, though he lives much of his life as a ranger under the name Strider. His destiny is fulfilled when he reclaims the throne as King Elessar.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What is Lothlórien?</h2>
      <p>Lothlórien is an Elven realm located east of the Misty Mountains. It is ruled by Galadriel and Celeborn and is known for its timeless beauty and golden mallorn trees. The Fellowship rested there after Gandalf’s fall in Moria.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What happens to Frodo after the Ring is destroyed?</h2>
      <p>Although Frodo succeeds in the quest, the burden of carrying the Ring leaves lasting wounds on his body and spirit. Unable to find full healing in Middle-earth, he eventually sails into the West with Gandalf, Bilbo, and the Elves to seek peace in the Undying Lands.</p>
